# ManagementPortal

Management Portal is a front-end component to manage resources registered in [Maritime Identity Registry](https://github.com/maritimeconnectivity/IdentityRegistry) and [Maritime Service Registry](https://github.com/maritimeconnectivity/ServiceRegistry), the core components of [Maritime Connectivity Platform](https://maritimeconnectivity.net/).

There are currently two implementations based on Angular, but with different frameworks. MCC Testbed WG is currently transitioning from ngx-admin to Clarity design because ngx-admin and its older dependencies have become outdated.

## Implementations

- Management portal powered by [ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin): https://github.com/maritimeconnectivity/management-portal-ngx-admin
- Management portal powered by [Clarity Design](https://github.com/vmware-clarity/ng-clarity): https://github.com/maritimeconnectivity/management-portal-clr
